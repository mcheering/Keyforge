# Keyforge

### Logo was created by a logo generator, svg files used for scaling

CS6251 - Final Project

### Special Mentions

I used product images from KBDfans.com, dangkeebs.com, and kineticlabs.com. I purchase all of my keyboard building supplies from these three websites. This is my favorite hobby, I've built 4 keyboards that I enjoyed building, and love using.

This was a fun project that let me explore different botstrap components, CSS animations for buttons, and show what I've learned with form validation.

## 3 new bootsrap components used

1.  Nav-tabs: This was used to create categories on my services page.
